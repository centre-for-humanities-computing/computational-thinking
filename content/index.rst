Computational Thinking
======================

The purpose of CT Code Camps is to enable students to enrich their subject-matter knowledge with digital tools and computational technologies. The main focus will be to understand how to convert real-world problems into computational problems. The skills learned from coding will then provided ways to solve those problems.
